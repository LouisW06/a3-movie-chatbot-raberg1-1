# Assignment 3 - Writeup

Assignment 3 is all about creating this natural language query system.  In order to do so, you have to write a lot of functions to retrieve infomation.  You will also have to write a function to return answers from a pattern-action list.  There is a lot of work to accomplish in this assignment, but this portion is intended for you to write about what you accomplished.

## Reflection Questions
1. In your own words describe the `search_pa_list` function.
The search_pa_list function essentially goes through a list of various patterns to find the one that matches the question the user is asking. If it is unable to find a matching pattern, it returns "Don't understand".

2. What movie did you add to the `movies.py` file?  What year was it made? Any specific reason you added that movie?
I added the movie jurassic park, made in 1993, because I like it and i think it is a cool movie.

3. What pattern / action did you add to the paList data structure?  Why do you think that is a useful pattern / action?
I added a second title_by_year pattern because some people might type "what movies came out in _" instead of "what movies were made in _", so i decided to add both options because it would be less confusing.

4. What is chatbot would you create that would be like this?  Describe why you would create it and what it would do.
I would create a chatbot like this that could do the same thing but instead with a database of animals. Example, you could ask it "What group does lion belong to?" and it would say "cats" or "mammals". I would do this because I like animals and I think a database of all animals would be a useful thing to have.

5. What was the most difficult portion of this assignment?
Geting the parenthesis to work is probably the most difficult part.

6. Did you write a new assert for your pattern action?
Yes
